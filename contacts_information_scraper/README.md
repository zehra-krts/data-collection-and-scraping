# Office Contacts Scraper (Anonymized Example)

This folder contains an anonymized version of a web scraping workflow used to extract office contact information from member detail pages on a directory-style website.  
All domain names, company information, and sensitive details have been fully removed for confidentiality.

### Key Features
- Automated page fetching using Selenium  
- Extraction of structured contact data using BeautifulSoup  
- Support for multiple contacts per company (wide → long format)  
- Logging system for resumable scraping  
- CSV export for both wide and long datasets  

### Files
- `office_contacts_all_clean.ipynb` — Main anonymized scraping notebook  
- `members_raw.csv` — Example input file with placeholder URLs  

This example demonstrates my experience working with data collection, automation, and data processing using Python.
